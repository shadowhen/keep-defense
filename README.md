# Keep Defense
A basic tower defense game but with a twist! A student game made for game 
design class at Mississippi State University.

## About
This repo is a fork from [student group project](https://github.com/Joshua5437/Game-3) 
for a game design class. The purpose of this repo is to provide more documentation 
about the project and to serve as an existing copy of *Keep Defense*. The 
project was the final group project for game design class, and it was made using 
lessons from design, prototypes, play-testing, presentations, and balancing.

### Game Design Class
The group project was made for game design class at Mississippi State University
in spring 2022. The course code is CSE 4453.

### Team Name
The team name is "The Reach" which was randomly given by the professor 
teaching game design class.

### Recorded Livestream
At the end of semester, the professor would demo all final group projects
on Twitch. The professor has recorded a [video clip for *Keep Defense*](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1492109765?collection=YGWPFhjc8RavRg).
